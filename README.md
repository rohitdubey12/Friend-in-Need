# Friend-in-Need 

Friend in Need is an Android app based on Parse framework. 
The app allows a user to post a help message ( Car breakdowns, book loans, giveaways etc.) to the users nearby and the interested users to respond to the post and volunteer to help.

The app has been developed using Parse framework with the example Anywall Tutorial (https://www.parse.com/tutorials/anywall-android) used as the initial template.
It uses Google Maps and facebook API for identifying users' location and authenticate them respectively.
